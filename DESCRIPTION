Description: An optimized agent-based model for simulating the academic job market
    in sociology. The package implements a high-performance simulation framework to
    analyze how different economic and institutional factors affect PhD-to-faculty
    transition rates. Includes scenarios for studying the impact of the 2008 recession,
    delayed retirements, extended postdocs, and failed searches on academic career
    pathways.
