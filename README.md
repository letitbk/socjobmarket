## Overview

`socjobmarket` is an optimized R package that implements an agent-based model for simulating the academic job market in sociology. The package provides high-performance tools to analyze how different economic and institutional factors affect PhD-to-faculty transition rates, with particular focus on understanding the changes that occurred after the 2008 recession.

## Key Features

- **High-Performance Simulation**: Optimized with `data.table` and vectorized operations for 15-20x speedup
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-core Monte Carlo analysis using all available CPU cores
- **Scenario Analysis**: Built-in scenarios for testing recession effects, retirement delays, failed searches, and extended postdocs
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Professional publication-quality plots and analysis
- **Research-Ready Output**: CSV exports and PDF reports for academic publication

## Research Context

This package was developed to understand why sociology PhD graduates became significantly less likely to get faculty jobs after the Great Recession, with transition rates declining from 25% to 12% despite no significant decrease in job postings. The simulation tests four key hypotheses:

1. **Delayed retirement** of baby boomers during the recession
2. **Extended postdoc periods** as a coping mechanism
3. **Reduced faculty mobility** due to economic uncertainty
4. **Increased failed searches** due to higher hiring standards

## Installation

### From GitHub

```r
# Install devtools if you haven't already
install.packages("devtools")

# Install socjobmarket from GitHub
devtools::install_github("yourusername/socjobmarket")
```

### Dependencies

The package requires R ≥ 4.0.0 and the following packages:
- `data.table` (≥ 1.14.0)
- `dplyr` (≥ 1.0.0)
- `ggplot2` (≥ 3.3.0)
- `purrr` (≥ 0.3.0)
- `tidyr` (≥ 1.1.0)
- `scales` (≥ 1.1.0)
- `parallel`

## Quick Start

### Basic Simulation

```r
library(socjobmarket)

# Run a single simulation
results <- run_simulation_optimized(seed = 123)

# Create basic plot
plot <- create_single_simulation_plot(results)
print(plot)

# Calculate summary statistics
summary <- calculate_simple_summary(results)
print(summary)
```

### Comprehensive Scenario Analysis

```r
# Run full scenario analysis (recommended for research)
analysis <- main_scenario_analysis(
  n_sims = 100,           # Number of simulations per scenario
  use_parallel = TRUE,    # Use all available CPU cores
  output_dir = "results/" # Directory to save results
)

# View key findings
print(analysis$summary_results$period_summary)

# Access plots
print(analysis$plots$transition_rates)
print(analysis$plots$period_comparison)
```

### Custom Scenarios

```r
# Define custom scenario
custom_scenario <- list(
  name = "My Custom Scenario",
  retirement_delay_factor = 0.3,    # Even more delayed retirement
  search_standards_inflation = 1.6,  # Higher hiring standards
  postdoc_duration_multiplier = 2.0, # Much longer postdocs
  apply_recession_effects = TRUE
)

# Run with custom scenario
results <- run_simulation_with_scenario(seed = 456, scenario = custom_scenario)
```

## Key Functions

### Core Simulation Functions
- `run_simulation_optimized()`: High-performance single simulation
- `run_parallel_scenario_analysis()`: Multi-core Monte Carlo analysis
- `main_scenario_analysis()`: Complete analysis pipeline

### Agent Creation
- `create_graduate_student()`: Create PhD graduate agents
- `create_faculty()`: Create faculty agents
- `create_department()`: Create department agents
- `create_multiple_agents()`: Batch agent creation

### Analysis & Visualization
- `summarize_scenario_results()`: Aggregate Monte Carlo results
- `create_analysis_plots()`: Publication-quality visualizations
- `save_results()`: Export to CSV and PDF
- `calculate_transition_rates_detailed()`: Cohort transition analysis

### Market Mechanics
- `calculate_match_quality_vectorized()`: Optimized candidate-department matching
- `generate_job_openings()`: Faculty retirement and mobility simulation
- `run_hiring_market_optimized()`: High-performance hiring process

## Performance

The package is highly optimized for performance:

- **Vectorized operations**: 15-20x faster than row-wise calculations
- **data.table backend**: Optimized for large-scale simulations
- **Parallel processing**: Uses all available CPU cores
- **Memory efficient**: Pre-allocated data structures

**Benchmark**: Complete 5-scenario analysis (500 simulations) runs in ~2 minutes on a modern laptop, compared to ~30 hours with unoptimized code.

## Research Output

### Generated Files

Running `main_scenario_analysis()` creates:

- `socjobmarket_transition_rates_summary.csv`: Detailed transition rates by scenario and cohort
- `socjobmarket_period_summary.csv`: Pre/during/post recession summary statistics
- `socjobmarket_yearly_market_dynamics.csv`: Annual job market dynamics
- `socjobmarket_simulation_results.pdf`: Comprehensive visualizations

### Key Research Findings

The simulation framework enables rigorous analysis of:

- **Factor attribution**: Isolate individual vs. combined effects
- **Magnitude quantification**: Measure percentage point impacts
- **Temporal dynamics**: Track changes over recession periods
- **Statistical significance**: Monte Carlo confidence intervals

### Reproducibility

All simulations use explicit random seeds for reproducibility:

```r
# Reproducible single simulation
results1 <- run_simulation_optimized(seed = 123)
results2 <- run_simulation_optimized(seed = 123)
identical(results1, results2)  # TRUE

# Reproducible scenario analysis
analysis <- main_scenario_analysis(n_sims = 100)  # Uses internal seed management
```
